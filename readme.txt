Enables a widget that allows comments (called pulses) to be posted on any page of the site. Integrates with Stream, Evaluate, and Co Author+ to bring additional functionality to the comment stream.


== Description ==

Pulse will allow you to create a dynamic stream of comments on the various pages of your site, allowing users to create a live discussion around the content you post.
The plugin sports a number of features to improve this stream:
* Character Count Limit, you can limit the number of characters users can use in their pulses, twitter-style.
* Tagging, posters can mark their pulses with arbitrary tags.
* URL Shortening, integrates with Bit.ly's url shortening service to automatically shorten links in pulses. A useful feature when you are limiting the character count.
* Pulse Rating, add a metric to each pulse to allow users to vote on which pulses are the best. (Requires the Evaluate plugin)
* Content Rating, display the pulse author's rating of the content that the pulse responds to. This lets you create a quick and simple review system. (Requires the Evaluate plugin)
* Co-Authoring, posters can name other users as being a co-author of their pulse. (Requires the Co-Author Plus plugin)
* Live Updating, a core feature of Pulse CPT, this feature powers the dynamism of the pulse list. (Requires the Stream plugin)


== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file into wp-content/plugins/ in your WordPress installation
2. Go to plugins page to activate
